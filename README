Bro::Iso_Over_TCP
=================================


A plugin for the Bro NIDS, mainly to parse S7Comm protocol data traffic. 
S7Comm is based on ISO over TCP (RFC1006), so the "main" analyzer is ISO over TCP. 
The plugin will feature a really simple ISO over TCP analyzer and a S7Comm analyzer.

The S7Comm analyzer covers all known function of the S7Comm protocol excluding the
cpu functions of the UserData packages. S7CommPlus analyzer is not finished and works to some
extend. It covers the base functions of this protocol and can be used to log some events, but
not the data (they will not be parsed).

This plugin was written as a part of a master's thesis at Fachhochschule in Aachen (Aachen
University of Applied Sciences). It was only tested with self-generated .pcap files from a Siemens
S7 1204 and some .pcap files I found in other GitHub repositories.
